            Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully as they contain important information about your legal rights, remedies, and obligations. By accessing or using the TokenMeter.AI platform and services (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use or access our Services.

          <h2>1. Account Registration</h2>
          <p>
            To use many features of the Services, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you must provide accurate and complete information and promptly update this information if it changes. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify TokenMeter.AI immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may never use another user's account without permission. TokenMeter.AI reserves the right to terminate your account if you violate any provision of these Terms or create risk or possible legal exposure for TokenMeter.AI.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Subscription and Payment</h2>
          <p>
            TokenMeter.AI offers various subscription plans for our Services. You agree to pay the fees associated with the subscription plan you select. All fees are exclusive of taxes unless stated otherwise, which are your responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you subscribe to our paid Services, you authorize us to charge the payment method you provide to us. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees using other collection mechanisms.
          </p>
          <p>
            All subscriptions automatically renew for additional periods equal to the original subscription period unless canceled before the renewal date. You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or by contacting our customer support team. If you cancel, you will continue to have access to the paid Services until the end of your current billing period.
          </p>
          <p>
            TokenMeter.AI reserves the right to change our prices. If we change prices, we will provide notice of the change on the Site or in email to you, at our option, at least 14 days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Services after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount.
          </p>

            Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you under these Terms will immediately cease, and you must promptly discontinue all use of the Services.

          </p>

          <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
          <p>
            You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless TokenMeter.AI, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms or your use of the Services.

          <h2>13. Miscellaneous</h2>
          <p>
            If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect. TokenMeter.AI's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of TokenMeter.AI. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and TokenMeter.AI regarding the Services and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral.
