# Project Overview ‚Äì TokenMeter.ai

## üß† Purpose

TokenMeter.ai is a SaaS platform designed to **analyze, optimize, and reduce the cost of LLM API usage** across different providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, etc.). The tool is built to be **truly functional and helpful**, offering actionable insights and implementation guidance that deliver **real business value**. It is intended for tech teams, developers, and companies seeking to monitor and control expenses tied to AI model usage.

## üéØ Core Goals (MVP Scope)

- Enable companies to **connect their LLM usage logs** (e.g., OpenAI API).
- Normalize logs from various providers into a **common schema** to enable consistent analysis and comparison.
- Analyze and visualize **token usage, cost trends, top models, and endpoints**.
- Automatically generate **cost-saving suggestions** based on usage patterns.
- Provide **copy-paste-ready code snippets** and direct suggestions that help implement savings quickly and seamlessly.
- Ensure all suggestions and logic are based on the **official documentation** of the respective model providers.
- Allow users to **sign up / sign in** (Google Auth via Firebase).
- Display dashboards (overview, charts, suggestions).
- Store and secure user data (Firebase backend).
- Make it **easy to onboard teams** and understand impact in $$$.

## üîç Key Components

- `SpendOverview`: Total usage + cost
- `SpendTrend`: Daily token spend chart
- `SpendRingChart`: Cost distribution per provider
- `TopModels`: Most expensive endpoints/models
- `SavingsSuggestions`: AI-generated suggestions to reduce spend

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Radix UI
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions)
- **Charts**: Recharts / Visx (TBD)
- **Auth**: Firebase Google Sign-in
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## üß™ Testing & MVP Goals

- The goal is to **launch an MVP within 1‚Äì2 weeks**.
- The MVP must include enough data and suggestion logic to run real analysis on OpenAI API logs and offer **real-time, actionable insights**.
- Suggestions must be based on official LLM provider documentation, ensuring **validity and trustworthiness**.
- Firebase will be used for real-time DB + auth, but no heavy backend infra required yet.

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Ideas (Post-MVP)

- Plug-and-play connectors for Anthropic, Gemini, Azure OpenAI
- Prompt quality scoring
- Prompt refactoring suggestions (auto)
- Slack / Email alerts for cost spikes
- Cost forecasting
- Role-based access


## üé® Design Direction

The visual design of TokenMeter.ai should follow a **modern, clean, and consistent SaaS aesthetic**, inspired by leading design-forward platforms. Key principles include:

- **Minimalist and focused**: Clean layouts with generous spacing and clear visual hierarchy.
- **Modern UX**: Smooth interactions, thoughtful animations, clear call-to-actions.
- **Brand coherence**: Unified color palette, consistent typography, and component design.
- **2025-ready**: Align with the latest web design standards for modern B2B tools.
